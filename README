To use this, the server must be started on the linode cloud server, and then the client can be run on your machine.
Also the C module could potentially need to be recompiled, see its separate readme.

Step 1. Install python dependencies
pytun
netifaces
pyroute2
dpkt


Step 2. Start server
Once the client starts, it will route all traffic over the tun interface, which will break any ssh connections.
Thus to be able to see the server running at the same time, you need to add a static route to the cloud server
over a default route.
E.G. on eecs:
  sudo ip route add 45.33.83.64 via 10.245.154.1
After this, ssh to the server:
  ssh root@45.33.83.64
The password is:  comp112project1
Then cd and start the server
  cd proj1new
  python3 server.py

Step 3.
In a new terminal, start the client.
  python3 client.py
Or to use the (faster) low latency always mode, do:
  python3 client.py ll
At this point all traffic should be over the vpn. You can check your ip at e.g. ipchicken.com

Step 4.
To see how things are going, in a new terminal run
  bmon
If you download a file, you should see some traffic over all your interfaces and the tun interface.
If you have multiple links, you can try adding/removing them and tcp connections should survive.
